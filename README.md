# Waste Management using CNN Model

This project aims to classify waste into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset consists of images categorized into 'Organic' and 'Recyclable'.
## DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data

## Project Structure

- `wasteclassification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Week 2 Work
### CNN Model

In the second week, the focus was on building and training a CNN model for waste classification. Below are the key steps and code snippets from the notebook:
1. **Model Architecture**
2. **Model Summary**
3. **Data Generators**
4. **Model Training**

## Results

The model was trained for one epoch, and the training and validation accuracy were monitored. Further tuning and training for more epochs are required to improve the model's performance.

## Conclusion

In the second week, a CNN model was successfully built and trained for waste classification. The next steps involve further tuning the model and evaluating its performance on a test set.
